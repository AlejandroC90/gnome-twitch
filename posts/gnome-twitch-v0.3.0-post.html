              <p class="text-left">
                So finally after 4 months of hard work (and many delays), the next major
                version of GNOME Twitch is available! Many new features have been added
                as well as a lot of groundwork has been laid for future devlopment.
              </p>

              <h4 class="text-left"><b>Revamped player</b></h4>
              <p class="text-left">
                A new system has been introduced using plugins as a way to load
                different player backends, so 4 different ones are now available.
                The new default player uses GStreamer and Cairo which removes any
                dependencies on Clutter. Of course if you liked the Clutter player
                then it is still available as one of the backends. Additionally a
                GStreamer + OpenGL backend has been added, should the Cairo one not
                be adequate. Finally due to popular demand, an experimental MPV backend
                also using OpenGL has been added.
              </p>

              <p class="text-left">
                The first time you open a stream, you will be asked to load a player
                backend. Hopefully you have one installed and all packages should at
                least by default install the Cairo + GStreamer one. If you want to use
                one of the other backends then some distros, like Arch, will soon have
                packages available to install. Otherwise you'll have to install them manually
                but this is super simple and instructions can be found in the
                <a href="https://github.com/vinszent/gnome-twitch/wiki/How-to-install-player-backends">
                  wiki
                </a>.
              </p>

              <h4 class="text-left"><b>Follows are now synced</b></h4>
              <p class="text-left">
                You might have already noticed in v0.2.1, but GNOME Twitch will now sync
                your follows if you are logged in. After logging in through the app menu,
                if you have any local follows, GNOME Twitch will prompt you if you would like
                move them up to Twitch. After that any following/unfollowing that you do, will
                be kept in sync with Twitch.
              </p>

              <h4 class="text-left"><b>New chat features</b></h4>
              <p class="text-left">
                Chat has been improved as well with new features and stability fixes.
                When the chat is docked you can now drag to resize and when it is undocked
                you use the controls in the menu to resize it and move it around.
                Links are now clickable and will open your default browser when clicked.
                A new emote popup has been added that will insert your favourite emotes easily
                into the text box. A noticeable fix is that the 'locking' behaviour has been changed,
                so now it's less likely for the chat to randomly lock/unlock. Also a max scrollback of
                1000 lines has been implemented, for better performance, this will later be changeable.

              <h4 class="text-left"><b>UI improvements</b></h4>
              <p class="text-left">
                A bunch of UI tweaks and improvements have also been introduced. Just to name a few:
              </p>
              <div class="text-left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Player can now be muted by <u>right</u> clicking on the volume button</li>
                  <li>Fullscreen bar is now animated when shown/hidden</li>
                  <li>All views now show some useful info when empty</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p class="text-left">
                All this plus a whole lot of work under the hood. I'll be updating with v0.3.1 soonish
                with any bug fixes and extra translations. I hope you enjoy the new release and look
                forward to v0.4.0!
