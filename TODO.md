## Roadmap
* Settings!

  * Window size

* CURRENTLY WORKING ON Favourite streams 
  * Notifications when one comes online
* Followed streams (requires logging in)
* Chat (requires logging in)
* ONGOING Localisation
* Screenshotting streams
* Recording streams
  * Will probably require recording from a separate stream because the encoder is much slower than the player and blocks the source when its queue fills up.
