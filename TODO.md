#TODO

## Bugs
[x] FIXED in #1. Need to put fullscreen bar in something that has its own window. Otherwise it tries to draw on the player's window which then gets over written by the player. 

## Roadmap
* Settings!
  * Quality
  * Volume
  * Window size
* Add extra info to games and streams
  * Viewer count
  * Time online
  * Follow count
* Favourite streams
  * Notifications when one comes online
* Followed streams (requires logging in)
* Chat (requires logging in)
* Screenshotting streams
* Recording streams
  * Will probably require recording from a separate stream because the encoder is much slower than the player and blocks the source when its queue fills up.
