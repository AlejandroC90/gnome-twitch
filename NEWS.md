# NEWS

* __24/06/2016__
    * Kind of old news but if you are logged in GT, will now get your follows from Twitch. Just be sure to refresh your login token so that GT can get new permissions if you haven't already.
    * GT now has a plugin system. Currently it's only for player backends but later on I will expand the API for other types of plugins.
    * There are now 4 backends available: gstreamer-clutter, gstreamer-cairo, gstreamer-opengl, mpv-opengl so feel free to try them out!
